# rock-paper-scissor
house rules:
rocks beats scissors

scissors beats paper

paper beats rock


getComputerChoice()


write a function that takes two arguments (getComputerChoice, getUserChoice) and tells the winner of the game

Need to repeat function calls so to play 5 round of a game.


Human Opponent is Computer in this game
Need two inputs . 1) Computer input 2)User input

1) Computer input will be taken from randomFunction()
2) User input will be taken from User using prompt()

write a function that takes both inputs and gives output who is the winner: ComputerInput(),UserInput()

In deciderFunctin we call Computer Input as CI and UserInput as UI

if CI has a rock and UI has scissors
then gives output as CI wins 

if CI has a scissors and UI has a paper
then gives output as CI wins

if CI has a paper and UI has a rock
then gives output as CI wins


if UI has a rock and CI has scissors
then gives output as UI wins

if UI has a scissors and CI has a paper
then gives output as UI wins

if UI has a paper and CI has a rock
then gives output as UI wins

if UI and CI both selects paper
then gives output as draw

if UI and CI both selects rock
then gives output as draw


if UI and CI both selects scissors
then gives output as draw






Write a gameFunction which will do the following things:
it will run the deciderFunction 5 times
it will receive the result each time 
Update function will update the score of both sides
after 05 times it will then display the final results.
